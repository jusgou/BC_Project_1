# The Human Robot
#
## SCOPE: Building investment options based on historical trends and benchmarks.
## We provide a robo-advisory dashboard 
## 
### ADDITIONAL NOTES: 
### Add flexibility
### If there is a threshold level of investment (say, $20M), there are more options available to customize their user experience (eg. more MC simulations)
### Allow for the choice of sectors/industries
### Contingency Planning: what happens in the event of a catstrophe
### Is it possible to project sharpe ratios (eg) into the future to take into account the future response to the volatility of markets. 
### Refining MC simulations: compute mean, standard deviation we can plot the high, low, mean outcome through time. This would be a way to create a robust projection of Sharpe Ratios into the future.
